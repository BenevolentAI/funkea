"""Composable components for functional enrichment analysis.

These components raise the layer of abstraction and make it easy to experiment with different
configurations. They are also useful for building more complex pipelines. For example, the
``funkea.components.variant_selection`` module contains components that can be used to build a
pipeline that selects variants based on a variety of criteria.
